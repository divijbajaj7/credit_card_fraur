# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

This repository contains a credit card fraud detection model that uses machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. The model was built using the Python programming language and scikit-learn library.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains credit card transactions a total of 284315 transactions, of which 492 (0.17%) are fraudulent.

Here is the link to the dataset:

The model uses a supervised learning algorithm called Random Forest Classifier to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. SMOTE is used to handle imbalanced datasets like the credit card fraud dataset.

The model achieved an accuracy of 99.98%, precision of 99.97%, and recall score was 1 on the test set.




### Deployment
In order to deploy the fraud detection model, I have used streamlit.

Here is the link to the web application: https://chandrima1-credit-card-fraud-detection-model-app-rjtw3p.streamlit.app/

Put all the V1-V28 features along with the amount(Normalized value) and predict whether it is a fraudulent or a legitimate transactions.

V1-V28: may be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features.
