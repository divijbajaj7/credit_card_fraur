# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

This repository contains a credit card fraud detection model that uses machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. The model was built using the Python programming language and scikit-learn library.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains credit card transactions a total of 284315 transactions, of which 492 (0.17%) are fraudulent.

The model uses a supervised learning algorithm called Random Forest Classifier to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. SMOTE is used to handle imbalanced datasets like the credit card fraud dataset.

The model achieved an accuracy of 99.98%, precision of 99.97%, and recall score was 1 on the test set.
